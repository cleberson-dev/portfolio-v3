      "description": "I love music. I play guitar often and occasionaly drums to express this feeling. Besides I enjoy playing video games, hanging out with my friends, making other people laugh, but I also enjoy spending time with myself to balance all of this. <br /> Studying programming for 4 years, building applications for 3 years, I've end up choosing the web as main platform for all of my creations, contributions and knowledge domain. As a self-taught guy, all of my knowledge has been achieved reading technical documentations, books, watching insights from other developers, as well as through my professional experience with great coworkers that I've met along my journey. As I just graduated, my goal is to gather more technical knowledge as well as obtain experience wherever I go to rise in my career and to bring software with better quality for everybody. I have big ambitions and I will do everything to achieve them in my journey, which I know it is long.",
